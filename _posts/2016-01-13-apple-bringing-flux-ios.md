title: Apple is bringing their F.lux equivalent to iOS
---

In November I wrote a [plea for Apple to bring the functionality of F.lux to iOS](http://chrisltd.com/blog/2015/11/apple-bring-flux-ios/). On Monday Apple revealed that iOS 9.3 would bring that functionality in the form of [Night Shift](http://www.macrumors.com/2016/01/11/apple-ios-9-3-night-shift/). It will be available for all 64-bit iOS devices.
