title: Back Dieter Rams documentary on Kickstarter
---

![Example of Dieter Rams work at Braun](/blog/images/2016/06/dieter-rams-braun.jpg)

Gary Hustwit, the director behind the excellent documentaries *Helvetica*, *Objectified*, and *Urbanized*, started a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1019019367/rams-the-first-feature-documentary-about-dieter-ra) to create a movie about product design legend [Dieter Rams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams).

[*Objectified’s*](http://www.hustwit.com/category/objectified/) best moments involved Rams, and I’m excited about seeing more about the man and work that is such a huge influence on the design work of [Apple’s Jony Ive](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8555503/Dieter-Rams-Apple-has-achieved-something-I-never-did.html).

I’ve already backed the project, and [you can too](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1019019367/rams-the-first-feature-documentary-about-dieter-ra) for $15.

*Update:* If you’d like to see some of Dieter Rams work in person, check out [this page on Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/artist/dieter-rams).
