title: Unsticky your navs

> “Please, publishers, lose your vanity, and kill the sticky navs. If I’m reading a story on Slate, have no need whatsoever to be reminded of the headline at all times — in extra-bold all-caps, to boot. &#91;...&#93; If you give me my browser window back, I’ll be much more avid, and much less resentful, when it comes to consuming your content.” *– [Felix&nbsp;Salmon](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/10/11/kill-the-sticky-nav/)*

Sticky navs[^stickynav] are trendy right now[^trendy], but you should carefully consider whether or not to to use them. Sticky navs take up valuable screen space – especially on mobile devices – while adding little functional value. After all, if your users scrolled down the page, they can certainly scroll up to use the navigation[^research].

[^stickynav]: A nav is sticky when it stays pinned to the top of the page even after you’ve scrolled down. For an example, check out [this Businessweek article](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-15/mcdonalds-low-wages-come-with-a-7-billion-side-of-welfare#r=hp-lst) or this poorly made [animated GIF](/blog/images/2013/10/sticky-nav.gif).

[^trendy]: I've been asked to implement them on most sites I've recently built.

[^research]: Users know how to scroll a window, [they just don’t like doing it too much](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolling-and-attention/).
