title: My Favorite Podcasts, 2014 Edition
---
A lot can change in a [year](/blog/2013/10/favorite-podcasts/), but I’m still listening to podcasts almost every single day. These are the shows I regularly queue up on my iPhone[^app]:

    <td class="aligntop padbottom"><strong><a href="http://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a></strong>. Programmers Marco Arment, Casey Liss, and John Siracusa discuss the latest technology news with a focus on Apple. Always thoughtful and funny. When I can, I try to catch the <a href="http://atp.fm/live">live broadcast</a> on Wednesday nights.</td>

    <td class="aligntop padbottom"><strong><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gabfest.html">Slate’s Political Gabfest</a></strong>. Interesting roundtable discussion of the week’s political news. I used to be addicted to cable news. This scratches the same itch, but is far less vapid and annoying.</td>

    <td class="aligntop padbottom"><strong><a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History</a></strong>. Dan Carlin tackles historical subjects with a mix of humanism and drama. Carlin’s series of <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-50-blueprint-for-armageddon-i/">episodes on World War I</a> have been incredible.</td>

    <td class="aligntop padbottom"><strong><a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/">Sound Opinions</a></strong>. An hour of music news, interviews, and reviews by Greg Kot and Jim DeRogatis. Sound Opinions is my primary way of finding new and interesting albums.</td>

## Honorable mentions

**[BS Report with Bill Simmons](http://grantland.com/podcasts/bs-report/)**. Sports analyst Bill Simmons discusses NBA and NFL news with a regular roster of guests. I personally skip the episodes about the NFL.

**[DLC](http://5by5.tv/dlc)**. Jeff Cannata and Christian Spicer discuss the latest news in video and board games with a different guest each week. The format is friendly, but I usually skip the bits about board games.

**[Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/)**. If you listen to podcasts, you’ve probably heard of Serial. It is good, but a real-life murder mystery might be too dark for some people.

**[The Incomparable](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/)**. Jason Snell and a revolving cast of guests discuss new and old geek media including books, movies, TV shows, and comics. Skip the episodes where they discuss things you haven’t had a chance to see or read.

**[Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w)**. Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin’s show about productivity. At this point, the show has devolved into a hilarious series of in-jokes with only some sprinkles of wisdom. You’ll probably be lost if you don’t go back and listen to some of the first shows.

[^app]: My new podcast app of choice is [Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8) for iOS. Sorry Downcast, I’m addicted to Smart Speed and server-side feed syncing.
