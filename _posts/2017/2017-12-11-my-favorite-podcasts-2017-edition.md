    <td class="aligntop padbottom"><strong><a href="http://www.vox.com/the-weeds">The Weeds</a></strong>. Featuring Matthew Yglesias and other contributors from Vox.com, The Weeds is a twice-weekly show that discusses the deeper policy side of American politics.</td>

    <td class="aligntop padbottom"><strong><a href="http://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a></strong>. Programmers Marco Arment, Casey Liss, and John Siracusa discuss the latest technology news with a focus on Apple. Always thoughtful and funny.</td>

    <td class="aligntop padbottom"><strong><a href="http://dobyfriday.com">Do By Friday</a></strong>. Ostensibly, Do By Friday is a weekly challenge show with Merlin Mann, Alex Cox, and Max Temkin. However, each episode is more like a dark comedy that touches on politics, culture, and sometimes tech.</td>

    <td class="aligntop padbottom"><strong><a href="https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast">The Bill Simmons Podcast</a></strong>. Sports analyst and former ESPN star Bill Simmons discusses sports and pop culture with a regular roster guests and the occasional celebrity. If you’re a NBA fan, the episodes with Kevin Durant are worth finding in the archives.</td>

## Honorable mentions

**[The Ezra Klein Show](http://exponent.fm)**. Ezra Klein, from the Weeds, interviews leaders in various fields. This year, I thoroughly enjoyed his episodes with Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Cal Newport.

**[The Vergecast](https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast)**. Nilay Patel and a rotating cast of characters from The Verge discuss the latest in tech and gadgets. Episodes are usually lighthearted and funny.

**[Sound Opinions](http://www.soundopinions.org/)**. An hour of music news, interviews, and reviews by Greg Kot and Jim DeRogatis. These days I skip most of the interviews and listen to the news and reviews.</td>
