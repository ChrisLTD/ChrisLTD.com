title: The 40-hour work week
---

[From Dustin Moskovitz](https://medium.com/@moskov/work-hard-live-well-ead679cb506d):

> The research is clear: beyond ~40–50 hours per week, the marginal returns from additional work decrease rapidly and quickly become negative. We have also demonstrated that though you can get more output for a few weeks during “crunch time” you still ultimately pay for it later when people inevitably need to recover

Workplaces that require regularly working more than 40 hours a week are hurting their employees and themselves.
