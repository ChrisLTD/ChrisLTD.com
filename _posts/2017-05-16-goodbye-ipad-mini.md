title: Goodbye iPad Mini?
---

Apple is [reportedly ditching the iPad Mini](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/16/apple-may-discontinue-ipad-mini/) in favor of their new $330 regular size iPad line. If true, that’s a big bummer for me. The iPad Mini was the perfect size for reading or watching videos with the device in your hand. The “normal” 9.7" iPads have always been a little too big and heavy in this regard. I’d often prop them up on my knees or set them down on a table after a few minutes. While that isn’t the end of the world, it often means craning your neck, which can’t be good for the long term health of your spine.

To echo [Michael Tsai](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2017/05/16/no-more-ipad-mini-updates-planned/), I hope the Mini isn’t being cancelled because of lower sales. Apple has only updated the Mini sporadically since introducing it, and I can imagine that hurt enthusiasm for the entire line.
