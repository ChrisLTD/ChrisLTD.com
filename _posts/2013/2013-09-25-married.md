It’s a day I will never forget and I’m happy we were able to spend it with family and friends. 

On a professional note, you can check out the [website I created for our wedding guests](http://chrisandandrea.us/). I also took the opportunity to design the print materials for our wedding using motifs from the website.

This is the design I created for the save the date cards:
