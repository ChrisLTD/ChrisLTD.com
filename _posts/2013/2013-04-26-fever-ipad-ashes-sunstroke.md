title: "Fever iPad Apps: Ashes and Sunstroke"
---

When I created an [iPad theme](http://github.com/ChrisLTD/fever_ipad_theme) for [Fever](http://feedafever.com/), I meant it as stop-gap solution until someone released a proper iPad app. Yesterday my theme, thankfully, became obsolete when two such apps hit the App Store: [Ashes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ashes-for-fever/id637978723?mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=cxyf8xxWmGo) and [Sunstroke](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunstroke/id488564806?mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=cxyf8xxWmGo).

I've purchased both apps, and my quick impression is that Ashes is slicker in terms of presentation while Sunstroke is more configurable[^config].

Here’s a screenshot of an article in Ashes:

And the same article in Sunstroke:

Ultimately, you can’t go wrong with either app if you’re in the market for an iPad and iPhone[^reeder] Fever client.

[^config]: For instance, in Sunstroke you can share articles with a larger number of apps.

[^reeder]: If all you need is an iPhone Fever app, you should also consider [Reeder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=cxyf8xxWmGo).
