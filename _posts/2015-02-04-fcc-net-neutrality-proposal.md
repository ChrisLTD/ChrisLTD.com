title: FCC Chairman supports net neutrality for wired and mobile networks
---

[FCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission) Chairman Tom Wheeler is [saying the right things about net neutrality](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/fcc-chairman-wheeler-net-neutrality/):

> I am proposing that the FCC use its Title II authority to implement and enforce open internet protections.
> 
> Using this authority, I am submitting to my colleagues the strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the FCC. These enforceable, bright-line rules will ban paid prioritization, and the blocking and throttling of lawful content and services. I propose to fully apply—for the first time ever—those bright-line rules to mobile broadband[^mobile_neutrality]. My proposal assures the rights of internet users to go where they want, when they want, and the rights of innovators to introduce new products without asking anyone’s permission.

We’re a long way from this proposal actually becoming policy, but this is an encouraging sign after [years of disappointments](http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5311948/net-neutrality-and-the-death-of-the-internet) from the FCC.

[^mobile_neutrality]: I’m surprised Wheeler is throwing his weight behind mobile net neutrality as well, but with [investment in wired networks declining](https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20150126/04502529814/what-billions-subsidies-bought-final-map-verizons-fios-fiber.shtml), it’s a forward thinking move.
