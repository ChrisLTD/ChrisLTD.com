title: WWDC 2015 keynote highlights
---
Yesterday, Apple announced a bevy of new capabilities for the OS X, iOS, and Watch OS at [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/). I was particularly impressed by these new features: 

* iPads will support [side by side apps](http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/08/side-by-side-ipad-apps-gallery/) [^ipadupgrade], and picture-in-picture video playback. 
* iPads also get a [cool new keyboard mode](http://www.imore.com/ipad-keyboard-gains-new-shortcut-bar-can-become-trackpad-and-more-ios-9) where two-finger swipes act like a trackpad while editing text.
* iPhones will now guess the name of unknown callers. It’ll do this by searching your phone’s data for clues linking a name to the unknown number.
* WatchOS gains a nifty [alarm clock mode](http://www.iphoneincanada.ca/watch/nightstand-apple-watch/) while the watch is charging.
* Developers will be able to make native Watch apps and watch face complications. [^complications]
* Apple Maps users will now have access to mass transit directions and schedule information. [^transit]
* Safari on the Mac gains pinned tabs and tab silencing.
* All iOS users should see some more free space with [App Thinning](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/06/app-thinning-will-be-a-major-boon-for-8gb-and-16gb-iphones-and-ipads/), where the App Store will only install the assets necessary for your device. [^assets]

If you’re curious, you can [watch an official video of the Apple event here](http://www.apple.com/live/2015-june-event/).

[^complications]: In my first couple weeks with an Apple Watch, I’ve found [complications](http://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8382865/apple-watch-complications) to be far more useful than standalone apps.

[^transit]: At first, transit functionality will only be available in Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, D.C., London, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Toronto.

[^ipadupgrade]: Unfortunately, I'll need to upgrade from my retina iPad mini before I can try the side by side apps. I'm guessing the retina iPad minis are too RAM constrained to run two full apps simultaneously. 

[^assets]: Currently, app downloads could include 1x, 2x, and 3x sets of artwork even though your device will only ever use one of them.
