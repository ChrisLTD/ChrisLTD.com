title: I guess I should try uBlock Origin
---

I’m ready to try [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), after reading [Les Orchard’s post](http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/) on how much tracking and advertising junk is in a simple [Verge](http://theverge.com) article:

> Devtools performed a second reload of the [The Verge] page to get an overall performance analysis. This time it downloaded 12MB - a little over 7MB in that is JavaScript!
> 
> Just to put this in some rough perspective: Assuming I had a 1GB / month data plan, I could visit sites like The Verge about 3 times per day before I hit my cap. If I'm lucky, some or most of this will get cached between requests so it won't be quite that bad. In fact, another report tells me that a primed cache yields 8MB transferred - so maybe 4 visits per day.

uBlock Origin is an ad and tracking script blocker for Chrome and Firefox [^ublocksafari] that is supposedly much quicker and less memory intensive than the more popular [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/). 

For now I’m going to try uBlock Origin in Firefox. Before I adopt a blocker in Safari – my main browser [^whySafari] –  I’m waiting for the [Content Blocking framework coming in El Capitan](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=511).

[^ublocksafari]: If you want to try uBlock in Safari, you’ll need to use the [original uBlock](https://www.ublock.org) rather than uBlock Origin.

[^whySafari]: I use Safari because it’s more gentle on my laptop battery, and I like the browser tab sharing between Mac and iOS.
