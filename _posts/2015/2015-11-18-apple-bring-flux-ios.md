title: Apple, please bring F.lux to iOS
---

Staring into bright blue lights all night [can be bad for your sleep](https://justgetflux.com/research.html), that’s why I’ve been running [F.lux](https://justgetflux.com) on my Mac for the last couple years. F.lux is a freeware utility that slowly makes your computer screen emitted light less blue and more orange as the sun sets. I don’t have any of my own hard evidence to back up F.lux’s claims, but my Mac screen seems less harsh at night, and falling asleep has been easier since I started using it.

Unfortunately, these days I tend to use my iPad and iPhone more than my Mac before bed, and F.lux (or a utility like it) is not available on iOS due to current App Store restrictions. For a [brief time last week](https://www.macstories.net/linked/sideloading-f-lux-on-ios/), F.lux offered a way to sideload their app on iOS devices through Xcode. However, Apple quickly shut them down. Given the sleep benefits and Apple’s push into health related software, I hope Apple finds a way to open F.lux related APIs in iOS 10 or provide their own solution.

If you’re interested you can [sign a petition](http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/allow-flux-on-ios) for Apple to bring F.lux to iOS, or duplicate [these Radars](http://www.openradar.me/search?query=f.lux).
