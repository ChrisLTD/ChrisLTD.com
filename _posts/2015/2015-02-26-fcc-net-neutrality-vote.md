title: FCC votes for tough net neutrality rules
---

The [FCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission) is making the [right enemies](http://publicpolicy.verizon.com/blog/entry/fccs-throwback-thursday-move-imposes-1930s-rules-on-the-internet) with [todayâ€™s move](http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/26/8114265/fcc-ruling-net-neutrality-victory-internet-title-ii):

> In a 3-to-2 vote, the Federal Communications Commission today established [a new Open Internet Order](http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7977569/its-official-the-fcc-will-seek-to-reclassify-the-internet-as-a-utility) that implements strict net neutrality rules, including prohibitions on site and app blocking, speed throttling, and paid fast lanes.

> Critically, the order also reclassifies internet providers' offerings as telecommunications services under Title II of the Communications Act. Though this is likely to provoke a challenge in court, Title II gives the commission the tools it needs to enforce these strict rules.
