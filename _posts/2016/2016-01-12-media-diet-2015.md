As you may have noticed there is a lot of James Bond and Fast and Furious in this list. I spent a week catching up with the Fast and Furious series before the release of the 7th movie. I’ve also been going through the James Bond movies with the [companion reviews from Dan Benjamin and John Gruber](https://david-smith.org/blog/2014/12/10/the-talk-show-bond/). This list does not include movies I re-watched nor books I re-read.
