title: iPad Safari split view and Second Browser
---

At WWDC today, [Apple announced](http://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/06/apple-previews-ios-10-biggest-ios-release-ever.html) when iOS 10 is released you’ll be able to run two Safari tabs in split view on the iPad:

Since running two Safari instances side by side was the *raison d’être* for my app [Second Browser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/second-browser/id1061436721?ls=1&mt=8&at=11l5Li), I’m happy [^ami] to announce that 1.1.1 will be the last version [^pointreleasebug].

A big thanks to everyone who downloaded and used Second Browser.

[^ami]: I am seriously glad Apple has built this feature into the system, apps like mine and [Sidefari](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sidefari-web-browsing-companion/id1046968235?mt=8) should have been unnecessary.

[^pointreleasebug]: Unless a future iOS 9 point release introduces some kind of catastrophic bug.
