title: Thoughts on free to play games
---
[Plants vs. Zombies 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plants-vs.-zombies-2/id597986893?mt=8&at=11l5Li) was released for free on iOS last week. PopCap, the publisher of Plants vs. Zombies 2, hopes to make money by selling power-ups through in-app purchases. Despite enjoying the first [Plants vs. Zombies](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plants-vs.-zombies-hd/id363282253?mt=8&at=11l5Li), I’ve been hesitant to try the sequel. I just don’t trust free games, especially after reading [Gamasutra’s article on how some game developers manipulate people](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RaminShokrizade/20130626/194933/The_Top_F2P_Monetization_Tricks.php) into spending money on in-app purchases.

If I like a game, I’m happy to buy additional levels or expansion content[^DLC]. In those cases the core gameplay isn’t compromised. It’s an honest transaction where you’re buying more of the same thing you already enjoy. However, with purchasable power-ups, you have to question whether or not a game is trying to frustrate you into paying your way past a challenge.

I much prefer buying a game knowing the developer tried their best to make it fun. [From what I’ve heard](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/115744), the in-app purchases in Plants vs. Zombies 2 are tastefully done, but I don’t want to constantly wonder whether a game experience would be more fun if I were spending more money.

[^DLC]: I’ve personally dropped a good chunk of change on more levels for Gears of War and expansion packs for Civilization.
