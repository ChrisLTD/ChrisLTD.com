Today [Sonos and Ikea announced a hybrid speaker lamp](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/symfonisk-by-sonos-and-ikea?utm_source=Vox+Media&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=cj-5040886&source=cj&cjevent=f7dd88ed5a4411e9813c00300a240610) called the Symfonisk that looks both beautiful and useful. It will cost $179 and be available in August.

Here’s the black version, but there is also a white model:

Currently, I use an [Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-echo-speaker-with-wifi-alexa-dark-charcoal/dp/B06XCM9LJ4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=amazon+echo&qid=1554760131&s=gateway&sr=8-5&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=243aaa5da81cd92d680dfbf7fbba7170&language=en_US) on my desk that is serving as nothing more than a glorified Bluetooth speaker for my Mac [^turnsout]. I'm thinking one or two of these Symfonisks could replace my [Phillips Hue Go lamps](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Portable-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B00UVHAC1O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=2OYMJAQF23JFE&keywords=hue+table+lamp&qid=1554759879&s=gateway&sprefix=hue+table+l,aps,136&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=chrisltd-20&linkId=e6071a46044f9dbead807c0941274bc8&language=en_US) and my Echo in one nice package. It also has the added bonus of supporting AirPlay 2, so pairing it to my computer and iOS devices will be much simpler.

[^turnsout]: As it turns out, I don’t really need a smart assistant when I’m sitting at a computer workstation.
