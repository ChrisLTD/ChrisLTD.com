title: DIY James Bond NATO watch
---

Ever since I first saw [Goldfinger](http://amzn.to/25Dwq58), I've wanted the Rolex watch and strap combination that James Bond wears in the film [^spectre].

However, I've never wanted it enough to drop $8,000 to buy a real [Rolex Submariner](http://amzn.to/1W1Q2M8). So instead, I built my own for less than $150 with an [Invicta Pro Diver watch](http://amzn.to/1N3PEW1), a [NATO strap](http://amzn.to/1RFcFk7), and a solid [spring bar tool](http://amzn.to/1N3PSN8). A spring bar tool is necessary if you’re going to swap watch bands.

If you want to attempt assembling your own, here’s a good video showing the process of changing the straps:

With all that done [^applewatch], here was the result:

[^spectre]:  It's such a great style that MGM brought it back for the latest Bond film, [Spectre](http://amzn.to/25DwIJq). The big difference is that the Spectre watch is an Omega rather than a Rolex. A Spectre edition can be [yours for $7,500](http://www.omegawatches.com/watches/seamaster/seamaster-300/master-co-axial-41-mm/23332412101001/).

[^applewatch]: It's a far cry from how easy it is to put on an [Apple Watch nylon band](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM9L2/38mm-black-woven-nylon).
