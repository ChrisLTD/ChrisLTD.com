title: Why the Microsoft Surface is failing
---
Yesterday [Microsoft announced](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2013/07/18/business-microsoft.html) that they lost $900 million due to the dismal performance of their [Surface tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface). From what I’ve seen, the Surface should be a decent competitor in the tablet market. So why has it underperformed? I have a theory:

## Consumers don’t want a Microsoft or Windows branded tablet

Sure, Microsoft and Windows are successful *products*, but they aren’t beloved *brands* like Google, Apple, and Amazon.

Despite great strides by Microsoft programmers, Windows is still synonymous with malware and crashes. It’s a product people use and buy not because they are delighted by it, but because it’s what they use at work[^biz] or because they don't care to switch. Microsoft itself carries a stigma from their [antitrust abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft) in the 1990s.

You can debate whether or not this is a fair characterization of Microsoft and Windows[^fair], but I don’t think you can discount it’s effect. Tablets are supposed to be new, cool, and fun. Microsoft and Windows are decidedly not.

[^biz]: Microsoft is still the king of the business market. They may have trouble connecting with consumers, but they know how to work with enterprise IT.

[^fair]: For the record, I like both my Windows 7 gaming PC and Xbox.
