title: The sad saga of Candy Crush
---
The maker of CandySwipe recently wrote an [open letter to the makers of Candy Crush](http://candyswipe.com/king.html):

>Two years after I released CandySwipe, you released Candy Crush Saga on mobile; the app icon, candy pieces, and even the rewarding, "Sweet!" are nearly identical. So much so, that I have hundreds of instances of actual confusion from users who think CandySwipe is Candy Crush Saga, or that CandySwipe is a Candy Crush Saga knockoff. So when you attempted to register your trademark in 2012, I opposed it for "likelihood of confusion" (which is within my legal right) given I filed for my registered trademark back in 2010 (two years before Candy Crush Saga existed). Now, after quietly battling this trademark opposition for a year, I have learned that you now want to cancel my CandySwipe trademark so that I don't have the right to use my own game's name. You are able to do this because only within the last month you purchased the rights to a game named Candy Crusher (which is nothing like CandySwipe or even Candy Crush Saga). Good for you, you win.

If you want to play a game like Candy Crush but without the [baggage](http://kotaku.com/candy-crush-saga-makers-go-after-the-banner-saga-for-1506188958) and [manipulative tactics](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RaminShokrizade/20130626/194933/The_Top_F2P_Monetization_Tricks.php), play  [Bejeweled](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bejeweled/id479536744?mt=8&at=11l5Li).
