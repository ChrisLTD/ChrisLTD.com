title: Entering the age of Apple Pay
---

Today I took a bold step into the future and purchased fizzy water at Duane Reade[^walgreens] with [Apple Pay](http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/).

I was skeptical that Apple Pay would be more convenient than using a credit card[^keynotevideo]. Even though I specifically told the cashier I wanted to use Apple Pay, it was still faster. Here’s what the process looks like in practice:

Currently, Apple Pay is available on all iPhone 6 models running iOS 8.1 or later. After linking your phone with your credit card, you can use Apple Pay at stores with [NFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication) payment terminals like McDonalds, Office Depot, Subway, and Walgreens. Beware, some retailers have disabled their perfectly capable NFC terminals in an effort to stop the adoption of Apple Pay[^currentc].

[^walgreens]: Duane Reade is a chain of NYC drug stores owned by Walgreens.

[^keynotevideo]: Using a credit card is nowhere near as painful as Apple tried to make it seem in their Apple Pay [promotional video](http://youtu.be/38IqQpwPe7s?t=44m13s).

[^currentc]: Best Buy, CVS, Rite Aid, Walmart, etc. are developing an alternative system called [CurrentC](http://currentc.com). It bypasses credit cards entirely and pulls money directly from your bank account. I’m sympathetic to their goal of avoiding credit card transaction fees, but their solution just [sounds terrible for consumers](http://www.imore.com/depth-look-currentc-and-personal-data-they-want-collect).
