title: Apple including Duck Duck Go in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite
---
From the [Duck Duck Go blog](https://duck.co/blog/safari):

> (...) at WWDC, [Apple announced](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/06/02Apple-Announces-OS-X-Yosemite.html) that DuckDuckGo will be included as a built-in search option in future versions of Safari on iOS and OS X. We are thrilled to be included in Safari and it’s great that Apple is making it easy for people to access our anonymous search option. This makes DuckDuckGo the first privacy-focused search engine to be added to one of the top four browsers and is a huge milestone for both us and privacy supporters. (...)

Duck Duck Go has been my search engine of choice for more than year now. It’s quick, respects my [privacy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy), and generally provides good results[^results]. Also, I’ve grown to really love their [!bang feature](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html)[^bang].

It will be great using Duck Duck Go on my iPhone and iPad without resorting to [my router hack](/blog/2013/04/duck-duck-go-iphone-ipad/). Still, I continue to hope Apple will give us the option to add any search engine we want to Safari. [Firefox](http://firefox.com) and [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)[^chrome] have had that ability for as long as I can remember.

[^results]: Sometimes I have to crawl back to Google if I’m searching for something obscure, but Duck Duck Go makes it easy enough to redirect to Google by adding `!g` to your search.

[^bang]: My favorites are `!mdn` to go directly to the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/), `!i` to go [Google Images](http://www.google.com/imghp), `!v` to go to [Youtube](http://youtube.com), and `!password` to generate a random password.

[^chrome]: If there was ever a browser that I’d expect to have limited search options, it’d be Google Chrome.
