title: Google Images-esque thumbnail gallery jQuery plugin 
---
I’ve been making an effort to package more of my front-end code into reusable JavaScript and jQuery plugins. My latest creation is the [Yo Thumbnail Gallery](https://github.com/ChrisLTD/yo_thumbnail_gallery)[^Yo]. It’s inspired by what you find in the Google Images [search results](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=doge)[^doge].

![Example of the thumbnail gallery plugin](/blog/images/2014/01/image-gallery.gif)

Clicking a thumbnail brings up a larger version of the image right beneath the thumbnail. You can navigate between thumbnails with the on-screen arrows or using your left and right arrow keys. The styling is intentionally sparse to make it easier to adapt to your own theme.

You can [read the usage details on GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisLTD/yo_thumbnail_gallery).

[^Yo]: I name my stuff starting with Yo, because of my company [Yoeyo, Ltd](http://yoeyo.com/).
