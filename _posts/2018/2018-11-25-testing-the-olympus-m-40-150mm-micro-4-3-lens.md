title: Testing my new Olympus M. 40-150mm Micro 4/3 lens
categories: tech

I traveled with Andrea out to a cold and overcast Pelham Bay Park to test out an [Olympus 40-150mm F4.0-5.6 lens](https://amzn.to/2FEpaCw) I recently purchased for our [Olympus OM-D E-M10 camera](https://amzn.to/2SaInNk) [^mouthful]. Between quick bursts of snow and rough wind, there was sunshine and gorgeous views to enjoy.

I'm pleased with the results, especially considering the lens was only $100 at Amazon. It isn't the [fastest lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_speed) out there, but it worked well enough in daylight and with a maximum focal length of 150mm I could really zoom in on faraway places like the island in the third photo above.

In case you're wondering what the lens and camera combo look like, here it is along with the kit lens in the background:
