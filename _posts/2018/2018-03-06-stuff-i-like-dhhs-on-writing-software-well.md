David Heinemeier Hansson, aka [DHH](https://twitter.com/dhh), aka the guy that created Ruby on Rails, has recently started a YouTube series titled ["On Writing Software Well"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9wALaIpe0Py6E_oHCgTrD6FvFETwJLlx). Each episode has been a deep dive into DHH’s programming style and the way he thinks about crafting software.  If you are a developer, especially one that works with Ruby on Rails, I recommend checking it out.

Here is the first episode:
