title: Windows 10 is out today
---

If you’re a user of a legit copy of Microsoft Windows 7 or 8, the [upgrade is free](http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/07/28/windows-10-free-upgrade-available-in-190-countries-today/). Although, I’d suggest waiting at least a month for the initial bugs and software incompatibilities to get worked out [^mac].

I’ve been a Windows user since [3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x), but these days I only use Windows for gaming. Even in my limited use, Windows 8 was a huge step back in usability from 7. I simply did not need and was confused by the touch screen interface Microsoft bolted onto the existing desktop UI. I can hardly imagine how confusing it must have been for the non-enthusiast crowd.

With Windows 10, Microsoft has fixed the worst excesses of 8. According to reviews from [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/review-windows-10-is-the-best-version-yet-once-the-bugs-get-fixed/) and [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/28/9045331/microsoft-windows-10-review), desktop users will get a desktop focused UI, and tablet users will get a touch UI [^manual].

[^mac]: I wait just as long when new versions of Mac OS X come out. 

[^manual]: With the option to switch manually between modes if you so desire.
