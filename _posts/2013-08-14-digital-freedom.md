title: Digital freedom from Google and Apple
---
> “I think it’s unwise to use many proprietary, hard-to-replace services in such important roles, and I think it’s downright foolish to tie that much of your data and functionality into proprietary services run by *one company* in *one account* that sometimes gets disabled permanently with no warning, no recourse, and no support.” *– [Marco&nbsp;Arment](http://www.marco.org/2013/08/13/google-blindness)*

I’m trying my best to avoid getting locked into Apple or Google’s platform. I use GMail, but only through a forwarded address. I use iTunes Match, but I keep my own DRM free music backups. My documents and photos are hosted on Dropbox and Flickr. I refuse to start buying movies on iTunes, Google Play, or Amazon because they can’t be used across platforms[^dvd].

While it would be easier to fully embrace Google or Apple services, I want the freedom to use different platforms now and in the future. Like Marco Arment, I don’t trust any single company enough to give them full control of my digital life.

[^dvd]: Could you imagine buying DVDs that could only be played on a certain brand of DVD player?
