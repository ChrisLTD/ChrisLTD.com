I feel Scott’s pain. I just finished integrating [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) into my workflow, and now I’ve found out I’m supposed to switch to [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)[^gruntgulp]. While I may be a late adopter of Grunt, it’s still only about two years old. Gulp has been around for less than a year.

Keeping up with the latest standards and tools in web development takes a significant amount of effort, and it can be tough to carve out the time to stay current while dealing with project deadlines. However, the flip side is that web development hasn’t stagnated and it’s far from boring. That’s a tradeoff I’m happy to make.

[^gruntgulp]: Grunt and Gulp are both great tools for automating your front-end build process. I can’t imagine using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) or [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) without one of them.
