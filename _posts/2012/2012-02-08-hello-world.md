My name is Chris Johnson and I’m a professional designer and web developer. On this shiny new blog I’m going to write about my work and other – perhaps more interesting – subjects.

I’ve wanted to start a blog for nearly two years, but until now I never managed to get rolling. To make sure I don’t lose momentum and abandon this blog, I plan to post at least once a week. Maybe more. If you’re lucky.
