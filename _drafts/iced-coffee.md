title: Make great iced coffee
---
Here’s a video from [Counter Culture](http://counterculturecoffee.com/) of my favorite way to make iced coffee. This iced coffee, unlike others I’ve tried, doesn’t need milk or sugar to be enjoyable[^drinkable]. Also, the method itself is not complicated nor does it require exotic equipment[^equipment]:

You can also [read a text version of the process here](http://counterculturecoffee.com/education/brewing-guide/iced-coffee).

[^drinkable]: Coffee is truly good when it doesn’t require milk or sugar to mask its taste. This goes for hot or iced brews.

[^equipment]: You can buy everything you need at most big grocery stores.
