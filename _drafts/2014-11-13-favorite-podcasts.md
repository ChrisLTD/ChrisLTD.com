title: My Favorite Podcasts, 2014 Edition
---
While I’m working, I like to hear little voices in my head. So, I often put on headphones[^headphones] and fire up a podcast[^app]. These are the shows I listen to each week:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="aligntop padright"><img src="/blog/images/2013/10/accidental-tech-podcast.jpg"></td>
    <td class="aligntop"><strong><a href="http://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a></strong>. Programmers Marco Arment, Casey Liss, and John Siracusa discuss the latest technology news with a focus on Apple products. This is a worthy successor to John Siracusa’s <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical podcast</a>, and Marco Arment’s <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build and Analyze podcast</a>.</td>

    <td class="aligntop padright"><img src="/blog/images/2013/10/sound-opinions.jpg"></td>
    <td class="aligntop"><strong><a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/">Sound Opinions</a></strong>. An hour of music news, interviews, and reviews by Greg Kot and Jim DeRogatis. Sound Opinions is my primary way of finding new and interesting albums.</td>
  </tr>

    <td class="aligntop"><strong><a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/">Here’s The Thing with Alec Baldwin</a></strong>. Alec Baldwin does informal interviews with famous people. Love him or hate him, you can’t deny that Alec Baldwin has <em>the</em> perfect radio voice.</td>
  </tr>

## Honorable mentions

**[The Incomparable](http://5by5.tv/incomparable)**. Jason Snell and a revolving cast of guests discuss new and old geek media including books, movies, TV shows, and comics. Skip the episodes where they discuss things you haven’t had a chance to see or read.

**[Gamers With Jobs Conference Call](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/podcast)**. Shawn Andrich and company share insightful opinions about the latest in the video game world. Check the episode posts on [GamersWithJobs.com](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/podcast) for timestamps that will help you skip to sections about specific games.

**[Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w)**. Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin’s show about productivity. At this point, the show has devolved into a hilarious series of in-jokes with only some sprinkles of wisdom. You’ll probably be lost if you don’t go back and listen to some of the first shows.

[^headphones]: [This headset from Klipsch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00452TDSY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00452TDSY&linkCode=as2&tag=chrisltd-20) has good sound quality and noise isolation for the price. 

[^app]: My podcast app of choice is [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l5Li) for iOS.
