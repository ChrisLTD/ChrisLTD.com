title: My iOS programming resources
---

I recently launched two iOS apps, [Long Day](http://longdayapp.com) and [Second Browser](http://www.secondbrowser.com). These were my first forays into the world of native app development after years of nothing by programming for the web.

Aside from the official [Apple developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/), I relied on a number of resources to go from idea to a working app available on the App Store.

Here are a few of the more important resources I relied on:

**[Big Nerd Ranch Objective-C book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/032194206X/?tag=chrisltd-20)**

My projects were new enough that I was able to develop them in Swift, but it’s still valuable to be able to read and understand Objective-C code if you’re in the Apple development ecosystem.

**[Apple Swift language book](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11&at=11l5Li)**

If you’re going to program in Swift, you shouldn’t skip out on the official book on the subject. It’s available free from Apple.

**[Bitfountain iOS video courses](https://www.bitfountain.io)**

The structure of these video courses have changed a bit since I originally purchased them, but they were invaluable for getting me up to speed with the basics of actually putting an app together in XCode. The courses come broken up into small 5-10 minute videos that are easy to watch even if you’re short on time.

**[Stanford Swift iOS iTunes U course](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099?at=11l5Li)**

A bit more rigorous than the Bitfountain courses, and they are free to watch. I haven't watched all of these, but I do highly recommend the Auto Layout tutorial in Lecture 2.

**[WWDC Videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/)**

If there is a framework you want to use, it’s probably a good idea to check to see if there is a WWDC video on the subject.

**[NSScreencast videos](http://www.nsscreencast.com)**

Professional guidance for using specific frameworks or techniques you might want to use in your apps.

**[Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com)**

Unless you’re working with a designer, you’ll probably need to create graphics for your app. I used Sketch. I’m more familiar with Adobe suite of tools, but Sketch got the job done and it’s a lot cheaper if you’re just dabbling.

**[Script to generate app icons in different sizes](https://github.com/smallmuou/ios-icon-generator)**

There’s literally a million app icon sizes you have to generate before you can submit your app to the store. This script from Smallmuou on Github did the trick.
